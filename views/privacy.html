All capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, unless otherwise noted. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service located at <a href="/#/terms">http://getservice.com/terms</a>.</p><h4>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h4><p>Any information is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you other notification, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p><h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4><p><u>Account Information</u>. You need to create an Account to use our Services. By creating one, we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number (<strong>"PII"</strong>).</p><p><u>Information you Provide</u>. You control what information, including PII you share with us. In connection with an Issue you post, you may provide without limitation, the details of your account with a Vendor, your confirmation number for a Vendor transaction, your name, your credit card number (for example, to get a refund), your postal address (for example, to send you a credit voucher or exchange item), or your phone number. The details you provide to us are completely up to you. However, we might need some information without which we will not be able to provide Services to you. For example, we will need your email address in order to communicate with you to get further details about the Issue, update you on the status of the Issue and for any other purpose related to the Issue.</p><p><u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</u>. Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p><p><strong>"Cookies"</strong> are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. . We may use Cookies to tell us how and when you interact with our Services , to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. However, if you don't accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p><p><strong>"Web Beacons"</strong> (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.</p><p><u>Information Related to Use of the Services</u>. Our servers may automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"). Log Data may include information such as a user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our user's needs and preferences. We may use a person's IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p><p><u>Information Sent by Your Device</u>. We collect certain information that your device from which you are using the Services (such as, mobile phone, ipad, computer, etc.) sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p><h4>Use of Information Collected.</h4><p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. We will use your PII to:</p><ul><li>provide Services, communicate with you and provide customer support in relation to the Services.</li><li>contact and communicate with Vendors to try to resolve Issues.</li><li>resolve disputes, collect fees (if any) and troubleshoot problems.</li><li>customize your experience and otherwise measure and improve our Services.</li><li>send you relevant emails and communications (including keeping you informed about our products, offerings and any promotional offers) that might be of interest to you (If we use your personal information to market to you, you will be able to opt-out of such uses).</li><li>enforce our agreements, terms, conditions, and policies, and send you notices and alerts.</li></ul><h3>Information that We Share with Third Parties</h3><p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p><p><u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers</u>. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services (e.g. companies that provide us services such as hosting and maintenance of our Site, data storage and management, etc.). These third-party services providers have access to your PII only to the extent needed to perform services on our behalf.</p><p><u>Information Shared with Vendors</u>. We may need to share some of your information, including PII, with the Vendor to which your Issue relates. We will share with the Vendor only the information that is relevant for the purpose of resolving the Issue.</p><p><u>Information Shared with Third Parties</u>. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p><p><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</u>. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p><p><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</u>. We may disclose any information about you to government, law enforcement officials, or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity</p><h4>Your Choices</h4><p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we'll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</p><p><u>Opt-Out</u>. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or communication in connection with the Issue.</p><p><u>Modifying Your Information</u>. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by logging in to your account or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@getservice.com">privacy@getservice.com</a>. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getservice.com">privacy@getservice.com</a> with your request. We'll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p><h4>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</h4><p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to "Do Not Track" signals received from various web browsers.</p><h4>The Security of Your Information</h4><p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p><h4>Links to Other Sites</h4><p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a "Third-party Service"). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner's or operator's privacy policy. We're not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service.</p><h4>International Transfer</h4><p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p><h4>Our Policy Toward Children</h4><p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p><h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4><p>California residents may request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties, if any, to which we disclosed their PII for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and the categories of PII shared with those third parties. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain that information, please submit your request by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@getservice.com?subject=California%20Privacy%20Rights">privacy@getservice.com</a> with "California Privacy Rights" in the subject line.</p><h4>Questions?</h4><p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getservice.com">privacy@getservice.com</a> if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p></div></div><div class="gs-footer"><p>&copy; 2015 SERVICE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.</p><div class="gs-social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/service" target=" _blank" class="gs-social-fb"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/service" target=" _blank" class="gs-social-twitter"></a></div><nav><ul><li><a ng-href="/#/contact"><span>Contact Us</span></a></li><li class="bullet"></li><li><a ng-href="/#/terms"><span>Terms &amp; Conditions</span></a></li><li class="bullet"></li><li><a ng-href="/#/privacy"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a></li><li ng-if="!auth.loggedIn &amp;&amp; !auth.user" class="bullet"></li><li ng-if="!auth.loggedIn &amp;&amp; !auth.user"><a ng-click="openLogin()"><span>Login</span></a></li><li ng-if="!auth.loggedIn &amp;&amp; !auth.user" class="bullet"></li><li ng-if="!auth.loggedIn &amp;&amp; !auth.user"><a ng-click="openLogin('create')"><span>Sign Up</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div ng-controller="NewserviceCtrl" ng-cloak="ng-cloak" gsappready="gsappready" class="ng-cloak gs-cloak"><div bn-modals="bn-modals" ng-switch="svcActive" ng-show="showService" class="gs-modal"><div class="gs-overlay-wrap"><div ng-click="gssvc.companyResults=null" class="gs-overlay-content"><div ng-click="closeConfirm()" class="gs-overlay-close">&times;</div><!-- Select a company.--><form ng-switch-when="company" name="svcCompany" novalidate><div ng-if="svcActive !== 'issue'" class="gs-icon"><span class="gs-icon-new gs-middle-center"></span></div><h1><span ng-if="!routeCompany"><span ng-if="auth.loggedIn &amp;&amp; auth.name &amp;&amp; auth.name !== 'Welcome'">Hi {{auth.name}}, &nbsp;<br class="gs-desktop"></span><span ng-if="!auth.loggedIn || auth.name || auth.name === 'Welcome'"></span></span><span ng-if="routeCompany">You have an issue with {{newsvc.company | gscap}},<br class="gs-desktop"></span><span>how can we help you?</span></h1><div ng-if="gssvc.error" class="alert alert-danger">{{gssvc.error}}</div><div ng-class="{'has-error':(svcCompany.$invalid &amp;&amp; svcCompany.company.$dirty)||gssvc.errCompany}" class="form-group pb20"><input type="text" placeholder="Type in any company" ng-model="newsvc.company" ng-keyup="gssvc.companySearch($event, newsvc.company)" name="company" ng-focus="gssvc.errCompany = false" required class="form-control input-lg gs-overlay-content-input input-validate gs-overlay-autocomplete"><ul class="gs-list gs-overlay-content-results"><li ng-repeat="result in gssvc.companyResults" ng-click="gssvc.companySelect($index)" class="form-control input-lg gs-overlay-content-input no-radius gs-overlay-content-result">{{result._source.Company_Name}}<span ng-if="result.loc" class="gs-desktop-inline">- {{result.loc}}</span></li><li ng-if="gssvc.companyResultsNew || gssvc.companyResults" ng-click="gssvc.companyResultsNew=false" class="form-control input-lg gs-overlay-content-input no-radius gs-overlay-content-result">Add new company ({{newsvc.company}})</li></ul></div><!--div(class="progress")div(class="progress-bar progress-bar-info progress-bar-striped", style="width:0")
